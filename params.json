However, congestion avoidance is to keep the network operate in the zone to the left of the cliff. \r\n\r\nDue to the information contained in the binary feedback is very few as it just tells the user whether the total resource used is below or under the maximum capacity. User can only use such information to make a decision in a decentralized fashion. To measure the goodness of the avoidance control algorithm, the authors use the four metrics which are efficiency, fairness, distributedness and convergence. The linear control model is analyzed well for the parameter selection to achieve a good performance in terms of this four metrics. Then a certain nonlinear control model is also analyzed here. \r\n\r\nAs the author mentioned, there are still a lot of questions to be addressed. Especially when the feedback is delayed a different amount of time before it arrives the different users. In such a case, the user will act to the feedback in a asynchronous manner so that the performance will be degraded a lot.  \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
